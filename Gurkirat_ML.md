Assuming you know ML , if not , its preferred study ML before diving into deep learning.

# Deep learning topics :
```
Difference between Neural nets vs Deep Learning.
How Neural nets learn ? feed forward propagation.
Back propagation and Gradient descent.
Transfer Learning, Batch Normalization,Hyperparameter tuning, Data Augmentation.
Activation functions. Ex : Sigmoid , ReLU , tanH etc.
Optimization (adam, RMS, RMSProp)
Different types of NN in Deep Learning . how do they work ? Ex : ANN, ConvNets , RNN , SOM etc
```

# From here You can choose to get specific :
```
NLP. Ex : ConvNets 1D , RNN 1D , Memory networks , Attention , BERT etc
Computer vision. Ex : ConvNets 3D , GANs etc
```
